## 🪐 Hi! I'm Juan Pablo

I develop open-source software, primarily Python tools and libraries,
to satisfy my own needs, curiosity, and interests, but maybe you will find them useful too 😉 

I am open to work, reach me out by email at juanpablo@jpscaletti.com 📫 and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpscaletti/) or [Twitter/X](https://x.com/jpsca)
